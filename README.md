_______________________________
This is a project activity of capacity 990 kW, which is Solar Ground Mounted grid connected solar
power generation project in the District Sabarkantha, in the state of Gujarat, in India. The purpose of
this plant installation and power generation is for captive consumption. The promoter of the project
activity is ‘M/s Sidwin Fabric Pvt. Ltd’ (herein after called as Project Proponent or PP). PP has the
full ownership of the project activity. This project is an operational activity with continuousreduction
of GHG, currently being applied under “Universal Carbon Registry” (UCR).

The purpose of the proposed project activity is to generate electricity using a clean and renewable
source of energy i.e., solar radiation. The proposed project activity of 990 kW was installed in one
phase. Operation of solar power plant in Sabarkantha district in the state of Gujarat are per details
listed below:

Taluka/ District/ Type/ Total installed capacity kW /Commissioning date
Himatnagar/ Sabarkantha/ Ground mounted/ 990/ 15/06/2021
__________________________
As per the ex-ante estimate, this project will generate approximately 1,734 MWh of electricity per
annum considering an average PLF of 20%. The project activity uses Mono Crystalline Axitec solar
photovoltaic technology to generate clean energy. The generation of power from solar photovoltaic
is a clean technology as there is no fossil fuel fired or no GHG gases are emitted during the process.
Photovoltaic module consists of several photovoltaic cells connected by circuits and sealed in an
environmentally protective laminate, which forms the fundamental building blocks of the complete
PV generating unit. Several PV panels mounted on a frame are termed as PV Array. Thus, project
activity leads to reduce the GHG emissions as it displaces power from fossil fuel-based electricity
generation in the regional grid.
